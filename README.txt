Let's join our strength and notebooks today,
To conquer maths with numpy arrays.
Amidst equations, we'll cry and hooray,
In AML's world, we'll find our own way.

give me your code
i'll give you mine
a system that is just divine

Now, let's dive into all these tasks,
With determination - not an easy ask.
so stop your slumber, you lazy frog,
Together we'll leap, no need to quack!
